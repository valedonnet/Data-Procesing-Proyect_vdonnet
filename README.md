# Data-Procesing-Proyect_vdonnet
A company has collected New York housing rental data from the Airbnb app during 2019. This dataset was used to train Machine Learning models during that year, in an open competition.  We will now use it to conduct a study about the variables that make up the dataset in order to understand it and draw conclusions about it.


Step 1: Loading the dataset
You can download the dataset directly from Kaggle.com or from the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/data-preprocessing-project-tutorial/main/AB_NYC_2019.csv. Store the raw data in the ./data/raw folder.

Step 2: Perform a complete EDA
This step is vital to ensure that we keep the variables that are strictly necessary and eliminate those that are not relevant or do not provide information. Use the example Notebook we worked on and adapt it to this use case.

Be sure to conveniently divide the data set into train and test as we have seen in the lesson.

Step 3: Save the processed dataset
After EDA you can save the data in the ./data/processed folder. Make sure to add the data folder in the .gitignore. The data as well as the models should not be uploaded to git.
